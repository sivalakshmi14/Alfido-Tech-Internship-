1.BASIC CALCULATOR 

A simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers.

HOW IT WORKS :

Run Basiccalculator.py

Choose the operation (1-4)

Enter two numbers

Get the result instantly!


EXAMPLE :

Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 1
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 3
5 + 3 = 8


2. NUMBER GUESSING GAME

Try to guess a random number between 1 and 100. The program gives hints if your guess is too high or too low.

HOW IT WORKS :

Run Numberguessinggame.py

Enter guesses until you find the correct number

The program shows the total attempts when you win


EXAMPLE :

Enter your guess: 50
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 75
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 63
Congratulations! You guessed the number 63 in 3 attempts.


3. TEMPERATURE CONVERTER

Convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

HOW IT WORKS :

Run Temperatureconverter.py

Pick a conversion option (1-6)

Enter the temperature

See the converted result


EXAMPLE :

Enter your choice (1-6): 1
Enter the temperature to convert: 25
25°C = 77.00°F


4. SIMPLE TO-DO LIST 

A command-line to-do list app where you can add, remove, and view tasks.

HOW IT WORKS :

Run Todolist.py

Use the menu to manage your tasks

Keep adding, removing

EXAMPLE :

--- To-Do List Menu ---
1. Add Task
2. Remove Task
3. View Tasks
4. Exit

Enter your choice (1-4): 1
Enter the task to add: Buy groceries
Task 'Buy groceries' added successfully!

Enter your choice (1-4): 3
Your To-Do List:
1. Buy groceries


OVERVIEW :

These projects helped me practice and understand Python basics. I learned how to work with loops, functions, conditional statements, and lists. They also gave me experience handling user input and solving small problems step by step. Completing them boosted my confidence in programming and showed me how to apply Python concepts in simple real world tasks.
